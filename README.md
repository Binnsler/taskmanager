# Task Manager

This is an API only task manager application that allows for the creation of Tasks by Users. It is not meant for production, rather a study of NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jest ( testing ), and JSON Web Tokens.

Not much point in running this locally since there is no UI, but if you want, run ```npm run dev``` to kick off the app which can then be accessed by a MongoDB GUI or the command line.
